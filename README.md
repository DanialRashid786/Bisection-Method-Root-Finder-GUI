# Bisection Method Calculator in python (GUI)

The Bisection Method Calculator is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to find approximate roots of mathematical functions using the bisection method. This tool not only calculates roots but also provides a visual representation of the function and the convergence of the algorithm.


## Features

- Root Finding: Utilizes the bisection method to calculate approximate roots of mathematical functions.
- Graphical Visualization: Offers a visual representation of the input function and the approximate root on a graph.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a straightforward interface for entering mathematical expressions and parameters.
- Interactive Results: Displays the results of each iteration, helping users understand the convergence process.
